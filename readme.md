## 3 Building

The source is not yet available on anywhere on the internet, so it is either you stole the source from me, or I gave the source to you.

### 3.1 Windows

To generate the sprites, you will need to download `gorender.exe` and either add it to PATH or tweak `generatevox.bat` to let it points towards your preferred directory. Gorender is avaliable [here](https://github.com/mattkimber/gorender).

You will need to run the `make` command on a linux machine or under WSL. With that being done, you should be able to find `cnsplat.grf`.
